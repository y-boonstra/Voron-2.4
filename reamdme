Flashing firmware on MCU

Flashing the new firmware to the FYSTEC SPIDER is best to be done via Micro USB. Log in on via SSH.

To compile new firmware to

make menuconfig

check the following options in menuconfig:
 
 
 
 
 
 

Save the configuration and exit.
Compile the firmware:

copy the firmware to the SD-card and rename it to firmware.bin
reinstall the sd-card and flash it.

If there is still a config mismatch due to an old klipper firmware running on the raspberry it needs updating to.
cd ~/klipper/
sudo cp "./scripts/klipper-mcu-start.sh" /etc/init.d/klipper_mcu
sudo update-rc.d klipper_mcu defaults

Building the micro-controller codeÂ¶
To compile the Klipper micro-controller code, start by configuring it for the "Linux process":
cd ~/klipper/
make menuconfig
In the menu, set "Microcontroller Architecture" to "Linux process," then save and exit.
To build and install the new micro-controller code, run:
sudo service klipper stop
make flash
sudo service klipper start
If klippy.log reports a "Permission denied" error when attempting to connect to /tmp/klipper_host_mcu then you need to add your user to the tty group. The following command will add the "pi" user to the tty group:
sudo usermod -a -G tty pi


In the menuconfig for klipper running on linux:
